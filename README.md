# Word Similarity and Relationships

## Project Overview

This project leverages the advances in natural language processing through word2vec (word embeddings) to study the similarity between words. Utilizing Stanford's GloVe project data  (Pre-trained word vectors generated by Stanford's GloVe unsupervised learning algorithm), the project implements a robust system for finding similar words and solving word analogies. This project showcases skills in handling large datasets, natural language processing, and implementing efficient algorithms.

## Key Features

1. **Word Similarity Search**:
   - **Find Closest Words**: Given a word, find the n closest words based on word vector similarities.
   - **Partial Analogies**: Solve analogies of the form "x is to y as z is to _____".

2. **Efficient Data Handling**:
   - Preprocess large word vector files into efficient binary formats using NumPy for faster loading and processing.

3. **Interactive Command-Line Interface**:
   - Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for entering words or partial analogies and getting real-time results.

4. **Advanced Visualization**:
   - Optional visualization of word vectors using PCA to project high-dimensional data into 2D space, enhancing understanding of word relationships.
     

## Technologies and Skills Demonstrated

- **Python**: Core language used for implementation
